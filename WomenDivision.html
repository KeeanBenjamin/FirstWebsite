        <p>Amanda Lourenço Nunes (born May 30, 1988) is a Brazilian mixed martial artist who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), in which she is the reigning champion of the women's bantamweight and featherweight divisions. She is the first woman to become a two-division UFC champion, and the third overall to hold titles in two weight classes simultaneously, after Conor McGregor and Daniel Cormier. She is also the first fighter in UFC history to defend two titles while actively holding them. As of June 2, 2020, she is #1 in the UFC women's pound-for-pound rankings. Nunes is widely considered to be the greatest female mixed martial artist in history.

                Nunes grew up in a small town outside of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. She started training in karate at age four and pursued training in boxing at the age of sixteen. She first competed in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu after being invited to a dojo by her sister, who also trained in the sport. Nunes made her Octagon debut against Sheila Gaff at UFC 163 on August 3, 2013, in Brazil. She won the fight via TKO in the first round. Nunes made her second UFC appearance when she faced Germaine de Randamie at UFC Fight Night 31 on November 6, 2013. She won the fight via TKO in the first round. For her third fight with the promotion, Nunes was named the injury replacement for Shayna Baszler against Sarah Kaufman at The Ultimate Fighter Nations Finale. However, Nunes later pulled out of the bout with a dislocated thumb. Nunes faced Cat Zingano on September 27, 2014, at UFC 178. After nearly finishing Zingano with punches in the first round, she lost the next round before being finished via TKO in the third round. Nunes faced Shayna Baszler on March 21, 2015, at UFC Fight Night 62. She won the fight via TKO in the first round. Nunes faced Sara McMann on August 8, 2015, at UFC Fight Night 73. She won the fight via a rear-naked choke submission in the first round, after knocking her opponent down with a three punch combination. Nunes faced Valentina Shevchenko on March 5, 2016, at UFC 196. She won the fight by unanimous decision (29–28, 29–27, and 29–27).

                After amassing a three-fight win streak, Nunes earned her first title shot in the UFC. She faced Miesha Tate for the UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship on July 9, 2016, at UFC 200. Nunes stunned Tate early on with knees and punches and then won the fight by submission (rear-naked choke) in the first round. Her victory made her the first openly gay champion in UFC history. On December 30, 2016, Nunes made her first title defense against returning MMA superstar Ronda Rousey in the main event at UFC 207. Nunes won the fight via TKO due to punches 48 seconds into the first round. Nunes moved up in weight to face Cris Cyborg for the UFC Women's Featherweight Championship on December 29, 2018, at UFC 232. Nunes knocked Cyborg out in 51 seconds of the first round to become the new UFC Women’s Featherweight Champion. This made her the first woman in UFC history to hold championship belts in different divisions simultaneously. This win also earned her the Performance of the Night award. Nunes faced Germaine de Randamie on December 14, 2019 at UFC 245 to defend her UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship. After outgrappling her opponent in every round, she won the fight via unanimous decision. This win meant Nunes had the most wins in women’s title fights in the UFC, with seven such wins. Nunes is expected to defend her featherweight title against Megan Anderson on December 2020 at UFC 256.

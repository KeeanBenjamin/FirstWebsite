        <p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion company based in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is the largest MMA promotion company in the world and features some of the highest-level fighters in the sport. The UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named "The Octagon". The UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl. The standard octagon has a diameter of 30 ft (9.1 m) with a 6 ft (1.8 m) high fence. UFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or is a fight card's "main event" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes. Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. All competitors fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Tops are only approved for female competitors. Required safety equipment include padded gloves, mouthguard, and protective cups held in place with a jockstrap for males. The open-fingered gloves have at least 1" of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170 g / 4 to 6 ounces) that allow fingers to grab. To ensure compliance, fighters are checked by a State Athletic Committee official before being allowed to enter the cage.</p>
        <p> UFC matches may end in five different ways: Knockout, Technical Knockout (TKO), Submission, Judges' Decision, Disqualification, No Contest, or Forfeit. A Knockout happens when a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.  If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. A submission is when a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. A disqualification can happen if a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory. A fight may also forfeit a match if he/she fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury. And finally, a match can end in a no contest if  a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances. When a fight makes it through all three or five rounds, three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer. Scores of 10–8 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10–7 rounds are very rare. </p>
         <p>UFC fighters are paid per fight, with amounts depending on how well-known the fighters are and how well sponsored a fighter and an event is. Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight, more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Cash bonuses are also awarded for "Fight of the Night" and "Performance of the Night". The size of these bonuses are normally $50,000, but can be as much as $80,000. </p></div>

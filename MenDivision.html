                Jonathan Dwight Jones, usually referred to as Jon Jones, is an American professional mixed martial artist currently signed to the Ultimate Fighting Championship, where he competes in the light heavyweight division.  He is the former two-time UFC Light Heavyweight Champion and is considered by many experts to be one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time. Jones first held the title from March 2011 to April 2015, and then from December 2018 to when he vacated the title on August 17, 2020. Jones also held the interim UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. As of August 19, 2019, he is #1 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings.

                Before beginning his MMA career, Jones was a stand-out high school wrestler and state champion at Union-Endicott High School in upstate New York. He also played football as a defensive lineman; due to his slight frame, his coach nicknamed him "Bones". He won a national JUCO championship at Iowa Central Community College. After transferring to Morrisville State College to study Criminal Justice, he dropped out of college to begin his MMA career. Jones made his professional MMA debut in April 2008. He amassed an undefeated record of 6–0 over a period of three months, finishing all of his opponents. In his last bout before signing with the UFC, Jones defeated Moyses Gabin at BCX 5 for the USKBA Light Heavyweight Championship. He won the fight via TKO in the second round.

                Jones made his UFC debut against Andre Gusmão at UFC 87 on August 9, 2008. Jones had accepted the deal on two weeks' notice as a late replacement for Tomasz Drwal. He put on an impressive performance, using takedowns and displaying unorthodox striking, such as spinning elbows and a spinning back kick. Jones won by unanimous decision (30–27, 29–28, and 30–27). In his second UFC match, Jones took on veteran Stephan Bonnar at UFC 94 on January 31, 2009. Jones showed superior wrestling abilities, executing strong takedowns as well as throws including a suplex. Again showing unorthodox striking as he had in his debut, Jones secured one of Bonnar's legs and landed a back-elbow that nearly knocked out his opponent during the first round. Although he appeared to tire in the third round, Jones held on to win another unanimous decision (30–27, 29–28, and 29–28) victory. Jones's third fight was against Jake O'Brien at UFC 100 on July 11, 2009. Jones controlled the majority of the match and eventually secured a modified guillotine choke, causing O'Brien to tap out. In September 2009, Jones was rewarded for his victories by signing a new, four-fight contract with the UFC.

                At age 23, with his victory over Maurício Rua at UFC 128, Jones became the youngest champion in UFC history. He holds numerous UFC records in the light heavyweight division, including the most title defenses, most wins, longest win streak, and most submission victories. During much of his championship reign, Jones has been widely considered to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. He has never been stopped or outscored during his career and his only professional loss is a controversial disqualification against Matt Hamill, a result that Hamill and UFC President Dana White dispute.
